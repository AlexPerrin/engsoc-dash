Engineering Society Dashboard is a central place that engineering students at Queen's University can come to manage various different aspects of their life as a student.

The long term goal of Engineering Society Dashboard is to serve as a place for students to apply for jobs, find tutors, attend conferences, join design teams, view events and manage their course work.
